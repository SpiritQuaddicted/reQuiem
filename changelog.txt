  - when exec'ing quake.rc, stuffcmds now is done before startdemos (fixes issue where a failed
      +load command still started demo loop)

  - added overbright world lighting option (gl_lightmode = 3)
  - added gl_texbrighten cvar to control whether bmodels should be loaded using a brighter palette
      (previous versions always did this; default is now to not)
  - sped up sky rendering in the following cases: solid sky texture; skybox with gl_skyhack=0;
      MH sky with gl_skyhack<2 (by rendering un-subdivided polys)
  - r_skycolor cvar now supports value of "auto", meaning color is calculated automatically based on
      map's sky texture.  This is now the default.

      - added support for the EF_ADDITIVE entity effect (for sprites *only*)
	  - so that additive blend works, sky now always gets drawn before sprites

        with filename containing both overall frame number and frame number within group)



0.94-b1: 2009-05-13

       new filename already exists (whew!), the compress prompt now comes before the overwrite prompt
  - if compressing a demo, and dzip/zip with current name already exists, an overwrite prompt is now shown
  - if demo being recorded is empty, it is deleted when the "stop" command is issued

      - after playing a demo that ended with an intermission screen
	  - when a server (or demo) issued a reconnect to a map that didn't exist client-side
      - when a map issued a changelevel to a non-existent map
  - fixed a bug in viewmodel and player lighting when ambient light level is 0
  - dynamic lights no longer affect the color of lighting on alias models (it just looked cheesy)

  - fixed bug in MH sky where surfaces that should be hidden by skybrushes were not
  - raised top of MH skybox slightly; reduced texture scale by a factor of 2
  - added gl_skyhack cvar to toggle skybox & MH sky optimizations (fast, but a bit buggy)

  - additional frustum-based culling is now performed on world model surfaces
  - fixed a bug where pressing esc from console would sometimes fail to bring up menu, but stop passing
      keypresses to console (eg. after using "disconnect" to close a map)
  - added a hack to smooth out motion of rotating entities
  - changed handling of oversized (>4096) coordinates so protocol hack is no longer required
  - when tab-completing a command or cvar, if cl_advancedcompletion=1 and there's only 1 match, a space
      is added after the cmd/cvar is filled in
  - raised some alias model limits (vertices & tris)
  - progs.dat with >32767 globals now work (max is 65535)
  - lowered view model a tiny bit (SSG was annoying me)



0.93-b2: 2009-03-06
  - "record" command now asks user for confirmation if a demo with the given name already exists
  - if client disconnected while recording a demo, compression procedure wasn't completed until
      a new map was opened.  Fixed.
  - if user was recording a demo and then changed maps (via the "map" command), compressing the

  - (internal): lines added to cbuf are now tagged with their source (cfg file, console, cmdline, etc.), 
      to enable smarter conditional handling
  - when changing gamedir, commands from command-line are no longer executed (eg. +map, +load)
  - if a map's worldspawn specifies a skybox that doesn't exist, no skybox is used 
      (previously, the skybox from the last-played map remained)
  - resurrection cheat didn't reset some values properly if player was gibbed.  Fixed.
  - when an alias model with the standard .mdl extension is to be loaded, reQuiem now checks for
      .md2 and .md3 files with the same name, and loads whichever is found first
  - md3: if a skin doesn't include a path, reQuiem now checks in the "textures" dir

  - replaced sv_oldprotocol cvar (0/1) with sv_protocol (0/15/10002)
  - changing the value of r_fullbright or gl_lightmode resulted in the lightmaps of the previous level
	being reloaded, even if the level was no longer open.  Fixed.
  - Linux: shift-tab key combo (for reverse-cycling of tab-completion results in console) was not being 
 	translated properly.  Fixed.

      - 0-9 keys quickly jump to a different time (0 = start, 5 = 50%, 9 = 90%, etc.)

      speed hit is negligible, so it's always enabled)
  - added progress bar to overlay shown during demo playback

  - added support for .ent files (in conjunction with new cvar sv_entpatch)
