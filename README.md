reQuiem
=======

reQuiem is a custom OpenGL Quake engine for Windows and Linux.  It's designed for maximum compatibility with all things Quake - past, present and future.  It's fast, reliable, and easy to configure.  In short: it fixes what was broken, improves what needed improving, and leaves the rest alone.
